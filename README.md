## Modeling 

Each model will be responsible of different data throught the app .

- User - focused on the user
- Submission - The user authors. Has different types (image/ video, text, link)
- Community - the category the submission belongs to 
- Comment - a response given to the submission from another user or the current user. 
- Subscription - Not be confused with billing of any type. A user can subscribe and unsubcribe to a community. # clone_reddit
